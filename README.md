# Humanoid Twerk Policy (Isaac Lab)

This project trains a humanoid robot in **Isaac Lab** to perform a **twerking motion in place** using reinforcement learning.

The learned policy controls joint positions to:

* keep **both feet planted**
* maintain a **wide, squatted stance**
* hold **bent knees**
* avoid **walking, slipping, or kneeling**
* produce a **rhythmic vertical pelvis motion**

This project is still a work in progress but below is an example of the best movement so far.
