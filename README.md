# Humanoid Twerk Policy (Isaac Lab)

This project trains a humanoid robot in Isaac Lab to perform a twerking motion in place using reinforcement learning.

The learned policy controls joint positions to:

* keep both feet planted
* maintain a wide, squatted stance
* hold bent knees
* avoid walking, slipping, or kneeling
* produce a rhythmic vertical pelvis motion

This project is still a work in progress but below is an example of the best movement so far.
